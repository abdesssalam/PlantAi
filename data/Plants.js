The disease spreads quickly in fields and can result in total crop failure if untreated. Late blight does not occur every year in Minnesota.Avoid planting tomatoes on sites that were previously in potatoes or close to potatoes. Sequential planting or planting several crops of tomatoes over time will reduce the risk of late blight destroying all tomatoes at once. Spraying fungicides is the most effective way to prevent late blight.Late blight is not a treatable disease and it will kill your plants. In addition, late blight is highly communicable disease that is carried on wind and will infect other gardens and farms within a 50-mile radius. So it is important to destroy infected plants once you confirm you have late blight.",
            "Prevention": "Remove and destroy affected plants. Do not compost. Do not plant tomatoes in the same area for 3 years. Rotate crops with non-susceptible crops such as beans, corn, cucumbers, eggplant, peppers, potatoes, and squash. Use resistant varieties. Use row covers to exclude insects."
